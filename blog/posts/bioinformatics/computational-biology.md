# Computational Biology: Algorithms and Applications

Computational biology sits at the intersection of biology, computer science, and data analysis. This field uses computational approaches to understand biological data and processes, particularly in genomics and proteomics.

## The Genomic Revolution

The ability to sequence genomes quickly and affordably has transformed biology. Modern computational techniques allow us to:

- Analyze genome sequences across species
- Identify genetic variants associated with diseases
- Predict protein structures from genetic sequences
- Model complex biological systems

## Machine Learning in Bioinformatics

Machine learning algorithms have become essential tools in bioinformatics:

1. **Supervised learning** for predicting gene functions
2. **Unsupervised learning** for discovering patterns in genomic data
3. **Deep learning** for protein structure prediction

## Current Challenges and Future Directions

Despite significant progress, many challenges remain in computational biology:

- Integrating multi-omics data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics)
- Developing models that capture the complexity of biological systems
- Creating interpretable AI systems for biological discovery
