# Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Guide

Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling machines to learn from vast amounts of data through neural networks with multiple layers. This guide explores the fundamentals of deep learning and its applications.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning can automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.
