# Bike Packing Adventures

Exploring the great outdoors on two wheels has been one of my favorite ways to experience nature. Join me as I share my experiences, tips, and favorite routes for bike packing.

## What is Bike Packing?

Bike packing combines cycling with minimalist camping. Unlike traditional bicycle touring with panniers, bike packing uses lightweight bags attached directly to the bike frame, handlebars, and seat post. This setup allows for better weight distribution and handling on varied terrain.

## Essential Gear

- **Bike**: A gravel, mountain, or touring bike works best
- **Frame Bags**: Handlebar bag, frame bag, and seat pack
- **Camping Equipment**: Lightweight tent or bivy, sleeping bag, and pad
- **Navigation**: GPS device or smartphone with offline maps
- **Tools**: Multi-tool, spare tubes, pump, and basic repair kit

## My Favorite Routes

1. **Olympic Peninsula Loop** - Washington state's stunning coastline and rainforest
2. **Arizona Trail Segments** - Desert beauty with technical challenges
3. **Central Oregon Bikepacking Route** - Volcanic landscapes and stunning vistas

## Lessons Learned

Every trip teaches me something new. The most important lessons have been:

1. Pack less than you think you need
2. Always carry more water than planned
3. Expect the unexpected with weather
4. Take time to enjoy the journey

Stay tuned for more detailed trip reports and gear reviews in upcoming posts!
