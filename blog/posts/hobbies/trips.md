# Recent Trips and Adventures

Traveling opens up our minds to new experiences, cultures, and perspectives. Here I'll share some highlights from my recent journeys.

## Summer in the Cascades

Last summer, I spent three weeks exploring the North Cascades in Washington. The alpine lakes, rugged peaks, and wildflower meadows were absolutely breathtaking. Some highlights included:

- Backpacking the Enchantments
- Fly fishing in remote mountain streams
- Wildlife encounters (including a black bear and mountain goats)

## Urban Exploration in Tokyo

A complete contrast to the wilderness experience, my trip to Tokyo was a dive into one of the world's most fascinating urban environments. I was particularly interested in:

- The intersection of traditional and ultra-modern architecture
- Food culture from street vendors to high-end restaurants
- Transportation systems and urban planning
- Technology districts and electronics markets

## Desert Southwest Road Trip

Most recently, I completed a 2,000-mile road trip through the American Southwest, visiting:

1. Grand Canyon National Park
2. Zion National Park
3. Bryce Canyon
4. Monument Valley
5. Santa Fe, New Mexico

The geological formations and cultural history of these areas provided endless opportunities for photography and learning.

## Planning Future Adventures

I'm currently researching options for:
- A cycling tour through the European Alps
- Volunteering with conservation efforts in Costa Rica
- A winter expedition to photograph the Northern Lights

Stay tuned for more detailed trip reports and travel tips!
