# The Glossary Map Project

Technical fields are filled with specialized terminology that can be overwhelming for newcomers. The Glossary Map project aims to create an interactive, visual way to explore and understand technical terminology.

## Project Overview

The Glossary Map is a web-based tool that:

1. Allows users to search and browse technical terms
2. Shows relationships between related concepts
3. Provides clear, concise definitions with examples
4. Generates visual concept maps to aid understanding
5. Uses AI to help users create their own glossaries

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using:

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, D3.js for visualizations, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **AI Component**: Integration with Claude API for generating definitions
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing term relationships and user-created glossaries

## Current Status

The initial prototype is complete with the following features:
- Basic term search and definition display
- Simple concept mapping for selected fields
- User authentication
- Glossary creation interface

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges has been ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated definitions. To address this:

1. We've implemented a review system
2. Added sources and references to definitions
3. Created a feedback loop for continuous improvement
4. Integrated expert-reviewed content for core concepts

## Next Steps

Future development will focus on:

- Expanding the visual mapping capabilities
- Adding more specialized domain-specific glossaries
- Improving the AI content generation
- Creating an API for developers to integrate with their documentation
