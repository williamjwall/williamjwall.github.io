# William Wall's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio page! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a software engineer with a focus on computational mathematics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and AI.

## Features

- **Interactive Triangles Animation**: A dynamic WebGL animation using K-means clustering to demonstrate my skills in computational mathematics and data visualization.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed descriptions of my projects, including technologies used and links to more information.
- **Contact Information**: Easy access to my contact details for potential collaborations or inquiries.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and animations.
- **WebGL**: For rendering the dynamic triangles animation.
- **K-means Clustering**: Implemented in JavaScript to demonstrate data clustering techniques.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the portfolio.

3. **Explore the Code**:
   - The main JavaScript files are located in the `js` directory:
     - `triangles.js`: Handles the WebGL animation and K-means clustering.
     - `script.js`: Manages the dynamic content and project rendering.

4. **Customize**:
   - Feel free to modify the content in `index.html` and the styles in `css/styles.css` to personalize the portfolio.

## Future Enhancements

- **Blog Section**: Plan to add a blog section to share insights and tutorials on computational mathematics and AI.
- **Additional Projects**: Continuously updating with new projects and experiences.
